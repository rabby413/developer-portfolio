                    addition
                    to
                    mastering HTML and CSS, he/she also knows how to: Program a browser (like using JavaScript,

                <p>So what is a “hero” in software development exactly? It can be that person who works long hours
                    without
                    stop. The first one to arrive and the last one to leave the office. However, one should be able to
                    do
                    their job in their time, if they can't, then that means there's something wrong that needs to be
                    fixed
